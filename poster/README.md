# Maze Solver â€“ Poster Summary

This document briefly introduces the project poster that complements the Maze Solver repository.

## ðŸ§© Poster Overview
The poster visually outlines how classic pathfinding algorithms â€” **DFS**, **BFS**, and **A\*** â€” solve a maze generated randomly at runtime. It highlights:

- The **objective** of the project  
- A comparison of **algorithm behavior**  
- The **maze structure and cell color legend**  
- Sample visual outputs for each algorithm  
- A **side-by-side performance comparison** (conceptual, not benchmarked)  

## ðŸ“¸ Why It's Included
The poster captures the **original, simpler version** of the Maze Solver interface. It helps illustrate the evolution from a basic UI to the current SFML 3.0.0-based implementation.

### ðŸ“Œ Note
The visuals in the poster were created before the final version of the project.  
While the core logic remains the same, the UI has since been improved to better align with modern SFML standards.

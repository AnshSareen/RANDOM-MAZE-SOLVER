### 🏁 Maze Solver in C++ (DFS, BFS & A*) with OpenGL Visualization

## 📌 Overview

This C++ project implements a Maze Solver using Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A Search Algorithm*. It features a dynamic visualization using OpenGL, allowing real-time pathfinding representation.

## ✨ Features

✅ DFS, BFS, and A* search for solving mazes efficiently.
✅ Real-time graphical visualization using OpenGL.
✅ Dynamic maze input (supports file-based or user-defined mazes).
✅ Tracks explored paths and highlights the final shortest path.

## 🛠️ How to Run

➡️Compile the program (ensure OpenGL is installed):
'''sh
g++ MazeSolver.cpp -o MazeSolver -lGL -lGLU -lglut
'''
➡️Run the program:

./MazeSolver

➡️Choose an algorithm:

1 for DFS

2 for BFS

3 for A*

View the visualization as the algorithm progresses.

🏗️ Future Enhancements

🔹 Customizable UI for interactive maze generation.

🔹 Support for larger and more complex mazes.

🔹 Performance optimizations for faster visual rendering.

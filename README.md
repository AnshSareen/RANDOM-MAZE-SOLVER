# Maze Solver ‚Äì SFML 3.0.0

A visual demonstration of maze-solving algorithms (DFS, BFS, and A*) built using **SFML 3.0.0**. It features random maze generation and a UI window to visualize how different algorithms explore and solve the maze.

## üìå Features

- ‚úÖ Uses **only SFML 3.0.0** ‚Äì no deprecated or 2.x APIs
- üé≤ Random maze generated every run
- üß≠ Choose from:
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **A* Search**
- üñºÔ∏è Visual representation of:
  - Walls and free paths
  - Visited cells
  - Final path from start to end
- ‚å®Ô∏è CLI selection with separate UI windows for input preview and final output

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

1. Install [SFML 3.0.0](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
2. Link SFML include and lib directories in your C++ compiler (Visual Studio recommended)
3. Compile with `sfml-graphics`, `sfml-window`, and `sfml-system` linked

### Example (Visual Studio):

- C++ > General > Additional Include Directories ‚Üí `SFML-3.0.0/include`
